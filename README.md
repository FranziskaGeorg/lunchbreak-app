## LunchBreak

It seems like "B.C." does not longer stand for "Before Christ", but "Before Corona" - 
a time when colleagues used to work together in an office and went to lunch at noon.
However, now that employees spend most of the week in home office, lunches with colleagues 
became very rare. And whenever you happen to work from the actual office, you have no 
idea who else might be a) there and b) down for lunch that day.

**LunchBreak** answers those questions by matching you with another employee, based on your 
preferred lunch days. This way, you cannot only catch up with old friends and colleagues,
but also with coworkers that you have not met yet. Happy lunch break!
